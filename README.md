# Skin-Cancer-Detection-Using-Semantic-Segmentation

### Problem Statement:
To design a model to semantically label the cancerous and non-cancerous parts in
dermo-scopic lesion images 

### Dataset:
ISIC 2018 skin cancer dataset

### Plan Of Action:
Unet, Segnet, Deconvolution and Deeplabv3 are the standard architectures used in medical
image segmentation. We will work on each of these architectures on skin cancer dataset.
Based on accuracy we will conclude which architecture holds good for skin cancer.

### Conclusion:
We dealt with various standard architectures of semantic segmentation such as U-net
architecture, Deconvolution-net architecture, Seg-net architecture and deeplabv3 architecture
on skin cancer dataset and we concluded that U-net architecture perform well for this dataset.
